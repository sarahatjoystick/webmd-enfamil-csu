					"What may contribute to fussiness and gas?",
					"It can be an indication your baby's digestive system is still developing. At birth, the enzymes that break down lactose and protein might not be yet fully active, which may lead to fussiness and gas. While it usually resolves over time, talk to the doctor to find a way to help your baby feel better."

					"What about a formula change?",
					"Enfamil Gentlease is an easy-to-digest formula that has broken down proteins. It's designed to ease fussiness, gas and crying in 24 hours. Inspired by breast milk, Gentlease has brain-nourishing DHA and other nutrients also found in breast milk that help your baby to learn, grow and develop."
				],
				[
					"i_img3.jpg",
					"How fast can Gentlease help?",
					"Gentlease can work fast - and provides all the nutrition of other Enfamil formulas. A clinical study of Gentlease showed significant reductions in fussiness, gas and hours of crying in just 24 hours*. If Gentlease helps, remember it's an everyday formula - and provides all the nutrition of other Enfamil formulas.",
					"*versus the same infants at the beginning of the study"
